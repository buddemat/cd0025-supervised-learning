    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

    "Out of the three tested models, the GradientBoostingClassifier performed best in terms of Accuracy and F-score. While the differences in the performance scores are not huge, they are noticable and clearly favor GradientBoost. \n",

    "While in terms of training times, AdaBoost is much faster, I would not weigh this factor too high. For the application case, training will be comparatively seldom and performance is very relevant. Granted, hyper-parameter optimization will take much longer than with other algorithms, but even a small increase in performance justifies that imho. In terms of prediction times, GradientBoost outperforms AdaBoost (even though all execution times are very low, so this may not matter at all).\n",

    "\n",
    "The model's performance is slightly better than that of the unoptimized one. While the increase seems to be rather low at first glance, it is an increase nonetheless and given the application case, the relatively small gain in prediction performance may very well result in a significant real-world financial gain. In that way, optimization can be considered a success, I would say. On the other hand, when looking at the individual scores of the grid search, there seems to be some fluctuation between the three folds of one parameter permutation, which in some cases is as large as the net increase of the scores between the unoptimized and optimized model, so I am wondering how durable the choice of best estimator is based on that. I also experimented with different values for the `random_state` and the changes in importance fluctuated as well, so there may not be any real sustainable increase in performance at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared with the naive model, the scores of both the unoptimized as well as the optimized model have greatly increased. Since the dataset is imbalanced (and I would think that probably the distribution in real life is even more so), the naive predictor only was correct in roughly 25% of the time. The optimized model should be able to make meaningful predictions.\n"

    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "Since we are trying to predict the income of individuals, I believe the following features would have the most predictive value:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Occupation: Income is probably highly correlated with the type of job. Jobs in manangement will earn a person more than, let's say someone in technical support. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Age: As people tend to gain experience with age and achieve seniority when being in a company for a longer time (or for that matter, having worked in a number of different companies), it is only logical that older individuals would generally earn more money.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Workclass: The class of work is likely also assciated with the probability of a higher or lower income, especially when looking at edge cases such as \"never worked\" or \"without pay\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Education level: On the one hand, generally, the level of education is likely correlated to the income. The rarer an education, the more someone that has the formal qualification can expect to make. On the other hand, there surely must be many people with a financially successful career or even their own business whose success did not depend or is built on formal academic achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Country: While the feature is not country of residence, but country of origin, I would expect the majority of people to work in their country of origin, even in a globalized world. Since levels of income hugely differ between different countries, this feature should have some predictive power. However, if it is really just the origin of different people all working in more or less the same economy (let's say the US), the expressiveness of this feature will be much smaller. \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The important features only partially overlap with those I discussed above, actually the only feature in both lists being `age`. I think there are different reasons for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) I suspect that the relationship between income and age that I argued is accurate. In fact, in the feature ranking by the GradientBoostingClassifier, `age` is actually the most important feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) In my rating above, I have largely disregarded `capital-loss` and `capital-gain` since I do not fully grasp what the semantics behind these variables are.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) My intuition on the feature `hours-per-week` was that people who work a lot of hours often may do so in lower paying jobs. I may have misjudged here, that on the other side of the spectrum, people in high-income jobs also tend to work more hours than average.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) It is noteworthy (and maybe even the pivotal point) that the most important features in the automatic rating seem to be _all the continuous numerical features_. Since the categorical variables were split up using the one-hot encoding scheme, this is not that surprising in hindsight - all former categorical variables are after all not a _single_ feature anymore  but a _series of features_ instead. So in the rating of the features by the GradientBoostingClassifier the parts of these split-up features probably have less predictive power by themselves.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
